*Note* This is a slightly udated version of a blog post I wrote years ago when first becoming a father.  It seemed appropriate to update this a bit for the launch of kevinb.us.  Hope that you find valuable questions and thoughts here today and in the future.

Let’s define what I mean by the term “hacker” first. There is so much fear, uncertainty, and doubt out there around this term. Large institutions want you to fear hackers, want you to think the hacker mindset is dangerous. This could not be farther from the truth. Hackers are simply empowered individuals that want to figure things out for themselves. It's obvious why institutions that have things to hide would fear the empowering mindset that hacking brings with it. In a post Snowden world I don't anticipate this fear dissipating.  With hacker properly defined, let’s get to the meat, why I want my daughter to be a hacker:

Hackers are not consumer lemmings – As large institutions continue to brainwash American citizens into becoming slaves to the systems they’ve created; hackers know that there is a life outside these systems of user dependence. Institutional dependence is literally killing us. Our dependence on the institutional food system has left us disease ridden and physically incapable. Dependence on western medical systems is bankrupting us. Our two major political parties both preach institutional dependence; one insists dependence on big government institutions, the other dependence on big corporate institutions. Hackers preach self and small community dependence, i.e. independence.

Hackers avoid what I call “The Knowledge Trap ” – Our education system is mostly about teaching people what to think, not how to think. This is true from kindergarten through undergrad. Hackers are more focused on skills than knowledge, and people with skills survive. It’s attitude that often make hackers so effective. Knowledge is least important because they have the skills to get the knowledge they need when necessary. And their independent attitude makes them resistant to appeals to authority. An Open mind is a mind with the capacity to learn and generate novel ideas.

Hackers can hack anything – They are not just limited to computers and electronics. They can plant vegetables in their lawns and by doing so hack the food system. They can install solar panels on their homes and hack the energy grid. They easily shake the fear that advertisers and politicians so efectively use to control many people in western society. Big institutional systems don’t faze hackers, they can see beyond them.

Hackers favor open systems – Hackers use and oftern favor open, non-controlling tools and systems. They support software freedom. This ensures that non-restricted tools will be available to hackers for generations to come; however they also enjoy breaking closed systems and using closed resources in unusual ways.

I’m sure there are many more reasons to encourage the next generation to embrace hacking. With the revelations and events of the past few years, encouraging the next generation of hackers and makers is more important than ever. Happy Hacking!
